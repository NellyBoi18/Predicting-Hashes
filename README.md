# Predicting Hashes

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10.7-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/)

## Description
This Python program takes in a CSV file containing a history of hashes and their results and uses machine learning techniques to predict future hashes. It aims to provide insights into the patterns and trends of hash generation.

## Features
- Import CSV file with hash history
- Preprocess and analyze the data
- Train a machine learning model
- Predict future hashes based on the trained model

- Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/predicting-hashes.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd predicting-hashes
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Place your CSV file containing the hash history in the project directory.
2. Run the program:
    ```shell
    python predict_hashes.py --input_file <csv_file_name>
    ```
    Replace `<csv_file_name>` with the name of your CSV file.
3. The program will generate predictions for future hashes and display the results.
